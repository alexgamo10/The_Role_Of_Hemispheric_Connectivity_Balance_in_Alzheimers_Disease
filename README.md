# The_Role_Of_Hemispheric_Connectivity_Balance_in_Alzheimers_Disease

This GitHub presents the code used during my final project degree called The Role Of Hemispheric Connectivity Balance in Alzheimer's Disease. In this project, it is assessed the relationship between hemispheric connectivity balance (phenomenon that states that fewer interhemispheric connections are compensated with more intra-hemispheric ones) and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Also, classification models are created for analysing if either the number of intra- and interhemispheric connections can be used for detecting AD at a preclinical stage and for knowing the current stage for a patient. These results are also compared with those calculated by using structural measures of the brain and finally both types of measures are used together for checking if connectivity is still relevant when doing so and if in this way better results are obtained.

This GitHub contains a folder called pipeline_for_processing_MRIs which has a link to the pre-processing on which I based for processing the MRIs of this study and my code for calling each part of this pipeline for each patient. Apart from that, this GitHub also contains another Jupyter Notebook called analyse_hemispheric_connectivity_balance.ipynb with which I addressed all the goals that have been previously introduced.
